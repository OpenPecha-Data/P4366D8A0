The Venerable Upāli asked the Buddha, the Blessed One: “ Reverend, as the Blessed One said,
it is proper to be ordained by five [people] including one vinaya master in the border regions.
If there are ten [people] there, and five [people] including a vinaya master perform
ordination, is it deemed a [proper] ordination or not?[The Buddha replied:] Upāli, as for
that, he is deemed to be ordained as a monk. [However,] the members of the Saṅgha will come
to be guilty of an offense.Reverend, as the Blessed One said, if one attains the [extra]
robe and ten days elapse, it will be an offense entailing atonement with confiscation. On
what condition does a deaf person obtain a robe?When, at the time of attaining, having seen
it, touched it by hands, or received it on the lap, he forms a conception ‘this is my
robe’, in this way a deaf person has obtained a robe.On what condition does a blind person
attain a robe?When, at the time of [attaining], having heard of it, taken it by hands, or
received it on the lap, he forms a conception ‘this is my robe’, in this way a blind person
has obtained a robe.Upāli asked the Buddha, the Blessed One: "On one half [of the bedding]
the picture is painted, and on the other half the picture is not painted. Is it proper
to stay there?"Upāli, it is improper. If there is another mat on its top or it is worn out,
it is proper.Reverend, the Blessed One said “Do not cross over the river while holding
onto a cow". Can you authorize to cross over the river while holding onto anything but a carriage?I
authorize it. There is no offense if one holds onto an ox, horse, buffalo, or yak
when crossing over the liver.

The Venerable Upāli asked the Buddha, the Blessed One: "Reverend, is it proper to take formal
possession of sugarcane juice for seven days?"[The Buddha said]: Upāli, it is proper. As
long as it is drinkable, when it does not become fermented, when it does not mixed with food,
when it is not sullied, and when it is not spoiled, it is not changed from the [original]
state of itself.The Venerable Upāli asked the Buddha, the Blessed One: “Reverend, is
it proper to eat salt boiled in improper fat?"[The Buddha replied:] Upāli, it is improper.
[However,] in consequence of making it proper, one does not become guilty an offense when
he eats it.[Upāli asked:] Reverend, is it proper to take an improper medicine boiled in oil?[The
Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper. When one applies it to his eye, ear, or nose,
he does not become guilty of an offense.[Upāli asked:] If a monk makes five kinds of seeds
proper [to eat] by fire, knife, or his nail, is he deemed to make them proper [to eat]?
Is it proper for him to eat [them]?[The Buddha answered:] It is proper, except for those attempts
to make proper by fire. That, which are the attempts to make proper, and which does
not make the seeds proper, will become guilty of an offense.[Upāli asked:] Is it proper
to eat a fruit when it fall down In a proper place, while the tree grow in an improper place?[The
Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper.[Upāli asked:] Is it proper to eat a fruit when
it fall down in an improper place, while the tree grows in a proper place?[The Buddha said:]
Upāli, it is proper as long as the day is over.

.

[Upāli said:] Five kinds of seeds and fire are on the proper ground, but one who makes thing
proper is on the improper ground. If he makes them proper by fire, knife, or nail, is he
deemed to make them proper or not?[The Buddha] said: they are made [proper].[Upāli asked:]
Is it proper to eat them?[The Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper.[Upāli said:] On the proper
ground, there is a monk. If he makes five kinds of seeds on the ground proper by fire,
knife, or nail, is he deemed to make them proper or not? Is it proper to eat them?[The Buddha]
said: they are made [proper].[Upāli asked:] Is it proper to eat them?[The Buddha replied:]
Upāli, it is proper, except for the those made improper by fire. In the process making
them proper, [if] the status of the seeds are destroyed, there is an offense.[Upāli asked:]
Is it proper eat [the seeds when one] carries them, [when they] are not roasted, [or
when they] are placed on the table or within the basket?[The Buddha replied:] Upāli, it
is improper.1[Upāli asked:] Is it proper to drink human breast milk?[The Buddha replied:]
Upāli, it is improper. In case of the purpose of eye medicine, it is not included.[Upāli asked:]
Is it proper to eat a sour juice at inappropriate time?[The Buddha answered:] Upāli,
it is proper.

.

The Venerable Upāli asked the Buddha, the Blessed One: Reverend, it is proper to eat human flesh?[The
Buddha answered:] Upāli, it is improper. Venerable [Upāli], in whichever the offense
happens, it is a serious offense.[Upāli asked:] Is it proper to eat the meat, which is
deliberately killed for the sake of other people, except for the human flesh?[The Buddha
answered:] Upāli, it is improper.[Upāli asked:] Is it proper to eat an improper flesh?[The
Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper.

eat the flesh of frogs?[The Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper.[Upāli asked:] Is it proper
to eat the flesh of all things having similar form?[The Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper.

The Venerable Upāli asked the Buddha, the Blessed One: Is it proper to take medicines [to be
consumed] in the morning2 and medicines [to be consumed] at night3 when they are mixed?[The
Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper.[Upāli asked:] Is it proper to take medicines [to be
consumed] at night and medicines [to be consumed] in seven days4 when they are mixed?[The
Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper.[Upāli asked:] Is it proper to take medicines [to be
consumed] in seven days and medicines [to be consumed] throughout life5 when they are mixed?[The
Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper.[Upāli asked:] Reverend, is there anything that
is [the medicine to be consumed] in the morning, and the very thing is [the medicine to
be consumed] at night, in seven days, and throughout life, is it proper to take it?[The Buddha
said:] Upāli, it is proper. Sugarcane juice is [the medicine to be consumed] in the morning,
and then the compressed juice [from the sugarcane juice] is [the medicine to be consumed]
at night. And then, the juice boils [for a certain amount of time]. It is the molasses
produced that is [the medicine to be consumed] in seven days. And then, the burnt [medicine
to be consumed] in seven days is the [medicine to be consumed] throughout life.

[Upāli asked:] is it proper that one particular substance can be [the medicine to be consumed]
in the morning, in seven days, and throughout life?

[The Buddha said:] It is proper. The meat is [proper] in the morning, after that the oil from
boiled [meat] is [proper] in seven days, after seven days the burnt ash is [proper] throughout
life.

.

[Upāli asked:] Is it proper to [take] the medicines [to be consumed] in the morning after they
have been stored?[The Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper. Likewise, [the medicines to
be consumed] at night, in seven days, and throughout life also improper.[Upāli asked:] Likewise,
is it proper to eat the improper things which were received and cooked inside but not
accepted as offering.[The Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper.[Upāli asked:] In a similar
way, is it proper to eat the things which are received but not given/formally given/a formal
possession/given as offering?[The Buddha said:] Upāli, it is improper.[Upāli asked:]
Also, is it proper for a monk who is not sick, to eat the things which are received but not
given as offering?[The Buddha said] Upāli, it is improper.[Upāli asked:] Also, is it proper
for a sick monk to eat the things which are received but not given as offering?[The Buddha
said:] Upāli, it is proper.

And then, the Venerable Upāli asked the Buddha, the Blessed One: "What can one give to a sick
monk?"[The Buddha said:] "He should give the sick monk the forbidden things by which the
monk can be cured."[Upāli said:] The Blessed One, if the eight kinds of drinks are administered,
[allowed to take them]. Among them, [if the drink from] roots is spoiled, [if the
drink from] stalks is spoiled, [if the drink from] leaves is spoiled, or [if the drink from]
flowers is spoiled, and when they are mixed, is it proper to drink them?[The Buddha said:]
"Upāli, it is proper as long as they are proper. When they are fermented, it is not allowed.
When they are not mixed with food and sullied, it is not allowed. Also, [in case] they
become spoiled, [it is not allowed]."

There happens to be a mad [man] and he takes formal possession [of a robe],Also, there happens
to be [a monk] who seated alone.The Community outside of the boundary cannot take formal
possession [of the robes].

[Upāli asked:] From a mad person, could one accept a robe?[The Buddha] said: From certain persons
it can be accepted; from others it cannot be.[Upāli asked:] From whom should it be accepted?[The
Buddha said:] "Who has father, mother, brothers, or sisters, or [in case the
robe] is given from his home, from him it can be accepted."[Upāli asked:] From whom should
it not be accepted?[The Buddha said:] "Who has no father, mother, brothers, or sisters, or
[in case the robe] does not come from his home, from him it cannot be accepted."[Upāli asked:]
"How can a mad man acquire and take formal possession of a robe?"[The Buddha said:]
"At the time when he comes to his senses."[Upāli asked:] "Reverend, when a monk stays alone,
people comes there to offer the robes for the sake of the Community. [The robes] should
be openly distributed by the Community. If so, how can that monk attain a robe?"[The Buddha]
said: “Upāli, on this background, the monk should think in the following way and say
- ‘When staying in this place, I was alone. This robe is for the Community and it is proper
to be openly distributed by the Community. However, it is apportioned to me and I will assume
authority over it, I will clean it, and I will preserve it. ’He should take formal possession
of it. If he cleans it, preserves it, takes formal possessions of it in this way,
it is said that the formal act has been performed."[The Buddha continued to say:] “Even
though a group of other monks have come, he should not give any share to them. If [the formal
act] has not been performed in that way, the monk who was alone should not provide the
robes. If they are distributed, he becomes guilty of an offense.Those monks also similarly
assume the authority over the robes, but the single monk took formal possession for the
sake of the Community. However, having gone out outside of the boundary, if he makes it his
own, he commits the duṣkṛta-offense.If the intention to commit stealing arises, it becomes
guilty of an offense.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “If a lay devotee happens to punish his son, can a monk receive a robe from him,
namely the son, or can't?"The Blessed One said: “That [robe] cannot be received.”[If a
donor says,] “This robe is offered to the Community of the rainy retreat”. It is not the
last month of the rainy season, and the kaṭhina-period has not started in that dwelling place.
[Also,] it is not the last month of the rainy season, and since the kaṭhina has not been
spread, the robes should be owned by the monks who have lived there during the rainy retreat.If
[a donor] says, “The robes belong to the present Community.” It is the last month
of the rainy season and if it is the kaṭhina-period in that dwelling place, or it is the
last month of the rainy season and if the kaṭhina robes have been spread in that dwelling
place, the [monks] who have not lived there during the rainy season, should also obtain the
robes.[If a donor says,] “The robes are offered to the present Community. They [are offered]
to the monks who will live here in the next year, the two following years, and the three
years.” Likewise, if [a donor] says, “The [robes] are offered to the monks who will live
up to ten years.” If the kaṭhina-period has started in the last month of the rainy season,
if the Community completed the last month of the rainy season, those monk to whom [the
robes] are given, should own [the robes]. Regarding first previous month, second previous
month, even so far as the tenth month/ten years, it is completely described.[Upāli asked:]
“After a monk has lived in the rainy retreat, if he goes out of the boundary for some business
of the Community, from where should he be given and own his share of the rainy retreat?”[The
Buddha said:] “[It depends on] what purpose of business he went out for and how
long he lived [inside of boundary].[Upāli asked:] “Should one give the share of the robes
to [the monk who] broke the rainy retreat?”[The Buddha said:] “It should be given to certain
persons; it should not be given to others.[Upāli asked:] “To whom should it be given?”[The
Buddha said:] “[It should be given] to those who had the early retreat or the late retreat
and to those who have lived long [enough in the rainy retreat.]”[Upāli asked:] “To whom
should not it be given?”[The Buddha said:] “[It should not be given] to those who had
neither the early retreat nor the late retreat and to those who have not lived long [enough
in the rainy retreat.]”

.

[Upāli asked:] “If a monk who takes care of [a sick monk] goes out of the boundary for some
business, after he goes out of the boundary if the sick monk passes away, should the robe
[of the dead monk] be given to the caregiver?”[The Buddha said:] “It should be given to certain
persons; it should not be given to others.”[Upāli asked:] “To whom should it be given?”[The
Buddha said:] “It should be given to the monk who worked for the sick monk; it should
not be given to the monk who worked for the sake of himself or others.”[Upāli asked:]
If a layman takes care of a sick monk, should one give a robe [to the layman] or should one
not?”[The Buddha] said: “It should not be given. Also, it should not be given to a nun,
a female probationer (śikṣamāṇā), and a female novice (śrāmaṇerī).”See the next records (four
and five records in the following)[Upāli asked:] “If a male novice takes care of a sick
[monk], should one give a robe to the him (the male novice; śrāmaṇera) or should one not?”[The
Buddha] said: “It should be given.”[Upāli asked:] “How many [of the robe] should be
given?”[The Buddha said:] “It could be all or the same amount [as it is given to the monks].”[Upāli
asked:] “If a caregiver entered the rainy retreat in a different place, should
the robe for the caregiver be given to him or should not?”The Blessed One said: “The robe
should be given.”[Upāli asked:] “By whom should the caregiving be performed?”[The Buddha said:]
“Preceptors, teachers, one whose preceptor is the same, one whose teacher is the same,
a preacher, all preachers, teachers, co-resident disciples, or disciples [should perform
nursing].Or, if there is no one [who performs nursing], the Community should appoint someone
to take care of [the sick monk]. If the Community does not appoint anyone, it becomes
guilty of an offense. If the caregiver does not take care of the sick monk, he (caregiver)
commits the duṣkṛta-offense. If the sick monk does not listen to the instruction of the
caregiver in accordance with Dharma, he (sick monk) commits the duṣkṛta-offense. Likewise,
if the caregiver doesn’t listen to the sick monk, it is also duṣkṛta-offense.”[Upāli asked:]
"How long should he take care of the sick monk?”[The Buddha said:] “Until the sick monk
passes away or recovers. Those who do not help [the sick monk] should be expelled; those
who help [the sick monk] should be retained. If they take the robes from a śikṣādattaka who
does not break any purpose, it is deemed to be a formal possession or attaining.”[Upāli
asked:] “How should one make the wealth proper?”[The Buddha said:] “Having made this improper
[wealth] proper, one should reflect that it is stored for the medicines for sick monks.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “A monk was not [staying in one place] before and afterwards. Is there any case
that a monk entered the rainy retreat in the four places during one [rainy season] and
he does not commit an offense?”[The Buddha said:] “Yes, there is. That is like this: Having
approached the boundary of the four places with the chair, mat, or curtain, if he entered
the rainy retreat, it is said that the entering [the retreat] has been performed. If it
is like this, there is no offense.”[Upāli asked:] “From where should he attain the share of
his robe?”[The Buddha said:] “It should be from all [four places].”[Upāli asked:] “If the
monk holds a summer raincoat which is smaller than his size, what is his offense?”[The Buddha]
said: “He commits the duṣkṛta-offense. In case of the cloth for covering sores as well
as the sitting mat, it is the same.”[Upāli asked:] “If the kaṭhina of the robe, which
has gone out and comes back, is spread, is it said that the kaṭhina has been spread, or is
it said that has it not?”[The Buddha] said: “It is said that the kaṭhina has not been spread.”[Upāli
said:] “What are the robes?”[The Buddha said:] “After being found in the road,
they are obtained."[Upāli asked:] “If one distributes a robe, which happened to be abandoned
[before], what is his fault?”[The Buddha] said: “He commits the duṣkṛta-offense.”[Upāli
asked:] “If [a monk] holds [one] of three symbols of other religions, such as being naked,
clothing made of feathers of the hawk (’ol ba; skt. cilla, chi. 鷂鷹), or clothing made of
hair, what is his fault?”[The Buddha said:] “It is the sthūlātyaya-offense.”[Upāli asked:]
“If one holds [a robe], which has a symbol of the other religions except those three symbols
of other religions, what is [his offense]?”The Blessed One said: “It is a duṣkṛta-offense.”

The first Chapter of Māṇavikā of the Vinayottaragrantha is completed.

[Upāli asked:] “Reverend, if the Blessed One stated, ‘if an old robe as the kaṭhina has been
spread, it is said that the kaṭhina has not been spread’, what is an old robe?”[The Buddha
said:] “It is the robe which has been spread before.”[Upāli asked:] “If the Blessed One
stated, ‘if a new robe as the kaṭhina has been spread, it is said that the kaṭhina has been
spread’, what is a new robe?”[The Buddha said:] “It is the robe which has never been spread
before."[Upāli said:] “The Blessed One [said], ‘A monk who spreads the kaṭhina, should
think about three things when the robes are accepted.' He shall keep [the kaṭhina] in the
foreground. At the time when the kaṭhina brought in then foreground, only three stitches
are sewn and the three things should be adopted.If it is said, ‘While washing, cutting, and
dyeing, make two and a half ecclesiastical boundary’, and if these three kinds of mind are
conceived when the kaṭhina is spread, is it deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread? Or,
[when it is said,] ‘I will spread this robe as the kaṭhina of the Community’ while conceiving
the two kinds of mind, is it deemed [that the kaṭhina has been spread]?"[The Buddha
said:] “If the kaṭhina has been spread with these two kinds of things in mind, it is the duṣkṛta-offense
in the kaṭhina ceremony.”[Upāli said:] “As it is said, ‘if the abandoned robe
has been spread as the kaṭhina, it is not deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread’, what
is the abandoned robe?”[The Buddha said:] “It is the robe, [which has been left behind]
more than ten days, or which was separated from one night."[Upāli said:] "As it is said, ‘If
the improper robe has been spread as the kaṭhina, it is not deemed [that the kaṭhina has
been spread]’, what is the improper robe?”[The Buddha said:] "It is the robe where the warp
is not proper."[Upāli asked:] “Reverend, if the Blessed One said, ‘If the old worn robe
has been spread as the kaṭhina, it is not deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread’, what
is the old distributed robe?”[The Buddha said:] “It is the robe, which has been constantly
worn by a monk.”[Upāli asked:] “If it is said, ‘If the robe, which has not been distributed,
has been spread as the kaṭhina, it is deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread’, what
is the robe, which has not been distributed?”[The Buddha said:] “It is the robe, which is
newly [made] from the warp.”[Upāli said:] “If it is said, ‘If the robe, which not only has
not been distributed but also is proper, has been spread as the kaṭhina, it is deemed that
the kaṭhina has been spread’, what is the robe, which not only has not been distributed
but also is proper?”

[The Buddha said:] “If the robe, which is possessed with the dark red color, has been spread
as the kaṭhina, it is deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “Reverend, in the dwelling place where the kaṭhina has not been spread yet, the
Community having been divided [into two groups], if the one side/group or the other side/group
from them spreads the kaṭhina, is it deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread?”[The
Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread.”[Upāli said:] “Is it
deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread by those all places?”[The Buddha said:] “Upāli, it
is not. It is deemed that the [kaṭhina] has been spread to those who spread, but it is not
deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread to those who did not spread.”[Upāli asked:] “Reverend,
in the dwelling place where [the kaṭhina] has been spread, the Community split [into
two groups]. If the one or the other group disposes of the kaṭhina, is it deemed that the
kaṭhina has been disposed of?”[The Buddha said:] “Upāli, [it is deemed that] it has been
disposed of.”[Upāli said:] “Is it deemed that the kaṭhina has been disposed of by all of
the those members?”[The Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is not. It is deemed that the [kaṭhina]
has been disposed of by those who disposed of, but it is not deemed that the kaṭhina has been
disposed of by those who did not dispose of.”[Upāli asked:] “If there is a Community that
is splits into a group [which has a correct view] and another group which has not, who
should perform spreading the kaṭhina?”The Blessed One said: “[It should be done] by those
who speak in accordance with the Dharma.”[Upāli said:] “Reverend, if the kaṭhina has been
spread, which is not [proper for] a robe of the Community, is it deemed that the kaṭhina
has been spread, or is it deemed that the kaṭhina has not been spread?”[The Buddha said:]
“Upāli, it is deemed not to be spread.”[Upāli asked:] “Reverend, the robe having been finished,
if the kaṭhina has been spread, is it deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread?”[The
Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is deemed that [the kaṭhina] has been spread.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “It is stated, ‘When a monk spreads the kaṭhina to sew up the edge at the end,
he should keep three things in mind’. Then, what are they?”[The Buddha said:] “He should
say that [firstly,] this robe should be spread as the kaṭhina of the Community, [secondly,]
this robe is being spread, [and thirdly,] this robe has been spread.”[Upāli asked:] “If
these three things are kept in mind like this, [when] the kaṭhina has been spread, is it
deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread? Or, is it deemed that [the kaṭhina] has not been
spread?”[The Buddha said:] “It is deemed that [the kaṭhina] has been spread.”[Upāli asked:]
“Also, he should keep two kinds of things in mind as aforesaid. If he does not keep these
two things in mind, what is [his offense]?”[The Buddha said:] “It is deemed that the kaṭhina
has been spread, but it is a duṣkṛta-offense [to the monk] spreading the kaṭhina.”[Upāli
asked:] “When the kaṭhina is spread in the dwelling place, how many causes should be careful
in an extensive way?”[The Buddha said:] “There are five things [to be careful. Firstly,]
whichever robe a monk attains or holds should be proper, [secondly,] entering into a
village without an outer robe, [thirdly,] collecting the food or eating the food repeatedly,
[fourthly,] practicing [the thing] not permitted, [finally,] wandering around the countryside
with a upper robe and a lower robe."[Upāli said:] “Reverend, how many causes and conditions
will not be disentangled, although [a monk] wears the outer robe?"[The Buddha said:]
“There are five things. Just as it is included in the vinaya, in the same way, the garment
worn in the rainy season should be worn, and so on.”[Upāli asked:] “What is the meaning
of the kaṭhina?”[The Buddha said:] The katḥina refers to a robe. It is the robe that the
kaṭhina has been spread for the Community.” 6[Upāli asked:] “Reverend, the Blessed One
said, ‘Upāli, you [should] work in the dwelling place’, what does it mean?”[The Buddha said:]
“It means that you should work in the dwelling place where the robe has been obtained."

.

[Upāli asked:] “The Buddha stated, ‘When a recent robe has been spread as the kaṭhina, it is
deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread’. What is the recent robe?”[The Buddha said:] "It
is the recently obtained robe/cloth by an opportunity on the same day."[Upāli asked:] “The
Buddha stated, ‘Three month having elapsed, if an obtained robe is spread as the kaṭhina,
it is deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread’. What is the robe that three months has elapsed
[after it was obtained]?”[The Buddha said:] “The resident monks (T. gźi na 'khod pa
rnams kyis; skt. naivāsika?) have stayed for fifteen days. Many visiting monks, who have
correct view and who are purified, came and they have stayed for fourteen days. If the visiting
monks (T. glo bur du lhags pa’i rnams; skt. āgantukā) have stayed like the residents
monks did, then those robes that are obtained [by them], are the obtained robes that three
months has elapsed. If those are spread as the kaṭhina, it is deemed that the kaṭhina has
been spread.”[Upāli said:] “The Buddha stated, ‘If a robe [attained at] appropriate time
is spread as the katḥina, it is deemed that the kathina has been spread’. What is the robe
[attained at] appropriate time?”[The Buddha said:] “It is the robe that is obtained in the
last month of the rainy season.”[Upāli asked:] “The Buddha stated, ‘If a worn out robe
is spread as the kaṭhina, it is not deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread’. What is the
worn out robe?”[The Buddha said: “It is the robe] that it becomes worn out from the body of
a monk.”[Upāli asked:"The Buddha stated], ‘If the five types of individuals spread the kaṭhina,
it is not deemed that the kaṭhina has been spread’. What are the five types of individuals?”[The
Buddha said:] “The one who has never been in the rainy retreat; the one who
destroyed the rainy retreat; the one who had the late retreat; the one who is expelled; and
the one who lives nearby the Community.”[The Buddha continued to say:] “According to the
Summary [of Vinaya Topics] (skt. mātṛkā), if the eight types of individuals [spread the
kaṭhina], the kaṭhina should be disposed of. It is not appropriate for the last two types
of the individuals to hold [the kaṭhina] except the remainders who hold [the kaṭhina] properly.”[Upāli
asked:] “If the kaṭhina is spread by less than four [monks], is it deemed that
the kaṭhina has been spread?”[The Buddha said:] “It is deemed that the kaṭhina has not been
spread. Likewise, if the fourth person is a layman, or even one who drew blood of the
Tathāgata with his evil intent, and if the fourth person spreads the kaṭhina, it is not deemed
that the kaṭhina has been spread.”[Upāli asked:] “Is there any case that when one spreads
the kaṭhina in a particular day, he ends [the kaṭhina-period] by not making a motion
in the same day?”[The Buddha said:] “Yes, there is. This is the case: the resident monks spread
the kaṭhina on the ground on the 16th day, and many visiting monks came. Also, they
were pure and had correct view (samānadṛṣṭi). They became associated with the dwelling place
and they have stayed for fifteen days. After that, they (the visiting monks) have stayed
in the same way the resident monks did, and if the poṣadha-ceremony is made on that day,
the kaṭhina-period is ended by not making a motion.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “To what extent is one person who causes the division of the Community?”[The
Buddha said:] “If somebody splits the Community of Disciples of the Tathāgata, he will attain
the sin which makes him fall into the Avīci. He also becomes one who commits the ānantarya
sin.”[The Buddha continued to say:] “Upāli, for example, a monk [speaks of] what is not
Dharma by means of the conception which is not in accordance with Dharma. Regarding eighteen
kinds of the cases, they are completely dealt with in the vinaya.”[Upāli asked:] “Those
who split the Community, do they all cause a conflict of the Community? Or, those who
cause a conflict of the Community, do they all split the Community?”[The Buddha said:] “There
is the case that somebody splits the Community, but he does not cause a conflict, and
there are four possibilities."[Upāli asked:] “What is the case that somebody splits the Community,
but he does not cause a conflict?”[The Buddha said:] “It is the case that although
the Community split, fourteen events which cause the division of the Community have not
occurred. That is the case that somebody spilts the Community, but he does not cause a conflict.”[Upāli
asked:] “What is the case that somebody causes a conflict in the Community,
but does not split the Community?”[The Buddha said:] “It is the case: The fourteen events
which cause the division of the Community, have occurred. That is the case that somebody causes
a conflict in the Community, but does not split the Community.”[The Buddha continued
to say:] "Also, the case that somebody causes a conflict in the Community as well as splits
the Community is like this: When it is the fact that the Community is split, the fourteen
events which cause the division of the Community have certainly occurred. That is the case
that somebody splits the Community as well as causes a conflict in the Community.”[Upāli
asked:] “What is the case that somebody neither splits the division of the Community nor
causes a conflict in the Community?”[The Buddha said:] “[It is the case] except for those
case [aforementioned].”[Upāli asked:] “When there is division of the Community, does it
always [entail] separation [from the Community]? Also, when there is separation [from the
Community], does it always [entail] division of the Community?”[The Buddha said:] “There is
the case that somebody splits the Community, but does not become separate [from the Community],
and there are four possibilities.”[Upāli] asked: “What is the case of the division
of the Community, but disagreement in the Community does not occur?”[The Buddha said:] “This
is the case: When the Community is split, separation from the Community [already] occurred,
or the robe has not been separated [from the owner]. That is the case of the division
of the Community, but separation from the Community does not occur.”[Upāli asked:] “What
is the case of separation/disagreement from the Community, but division of the Community
does not occur?”[The Buddha said:] “This is the case: “Two groups having been separated, and
then [the rest] was completely [described]. As long as the Community is not split, even
though the separation from the Community occurs, the Community has not split.”[Upāli asked:]
“What is the case of division of the Community, and separation from the Community also
occurs?”[The Buddh said:] “This is a case: the Community is split, and separation from the
Community occurs by living in two Communities, by [having] the boundary, by attaining [offerings],
and by using the robe separately. That is the case of division of the Community,
and separation from the Community also occurs.”[Upāli asked:] “What is the case that the
Community is neither split, nor separation of the Community occur?”[The Buddha said:] “[It
is the case] apart from the [aforementioned] cases.”[Upāli asked:] "Does the division of
the Community always entail separation of the Community? Or, does the separation of the Community
always entail division of the Community?"[The Buddha said:] “There might be a case
that the Community has been split and the Community is either separated or not separated,
and there are four possibilities.”[The Buddha continued to say:] “If asked, what is the
case that the Community has been split, but the Community is not separated?It is like this:
Although the Community has been split, the Community is not separated from two dwelling
places and from [distribution of] the robe. Thas is the case that although the Community has
been split, the Community is not separated.”[The Buddha said:] “If asked, what is the case
that the Community has been separated, but the Community has not been split?It is like
this: The Community has been separated by two dwelling places, the boundary, and the obtainment
[of offering]. That is the case that the Community has been separated, but the Community
has not been split.”[The Buddha said:] “If asked, what is the case that the Community
has been split and also separated?It is like this: The Community has been split and separately
settled in two dwelling places, and the other cases were aforementioned.”[The Buddha
said:] “If asked, what is the case that the Community is neither split nor separated? [It
is the case] apart from those aforementioned.”[Upāli asked:] “After the Community has been
split, if the boundary is dissolved by the one or the other group from the separated Community,
is it deemed that [the boundary] has been dissolved?”[The Buddha said:] “If [the
boundary] is dissolved by the group that preach the dharma correctly, it is deemed that [the
boundary] has been dissolved.”[Upāli asked:] “After the Community has been split, if a
group [of monks] stayed separately and settled down, should nuns perform the Poṣadha ceremony?”[The
Buddha said: “Yes,] they should.”[Upāli asked:] “Why is this?”[The Buddha said:]
“This is because nuns and monks stay separately.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “The Community having split [into two groups], if the one group lives correctly
and the other does not, how should meditators (sthalastha) perform [the Poṣadha ceremony]?”[The
Buddha said:] “They should go outside of the boundary and perform the Poṣadha ceremony.”[Upāli
asked:] “The Community having split [into two groups], if the one and the other
group are seated within the boundary, who should teach nuns?”[The Buddha said:] “It is
the group that speaks the Dharma correctly. Or, the mediators that speak the Dharma correctly,
should go outside of the boundary and teach [the nuns].”[Upāli asked:] “If there is
someone who agrees with the suspended monk, what is the offense?”[The Buddha said:] “It is
a duṣkṛta-offense of both men. Also, it is a pāyantikā-offense of the suspended monk (or
the follower).”[Upāli asked:] “Should it be said that a suspended monk can be together with
a companion or that he cannot be with a companion?”[The Buddha said:] “It should be said
that the suspended monk is alone in all aspects, and he is alone without companion.”[Upāli
asked:] “Should a monk practice together with a suspended monk, or should he not?”[The Buddha
said:] “The suspended monk should not practice with anyone and in any circumstance.”[Uāpli
asked:] “If one does not know the fact that the monk is suspended, can he eat together
(share daily life) with him?[The Buddha said] “If he does not know the fact that the monk
is suspended, even if he lives with him and eat together (share daily life) with him,
he does not become guilty of an offense.”[The Buddha continued to say:] “If the accepted group
eats together with the unaccepted group, [the accepted group] commits a duṣkṛta-offense.
If the unaccepted group eats together with the accepted group, [the unaccepted group]
commits a duṣkṛta-offense. If there are four persons agreeing with those who cause a division
of the Community, it should be said that the Community has been spilt.If there are four
persons agreeing with the one who causes a division of the Community, there is a division
of the Community."

.

[Upāli asked:] “Reverend, the Blessed One stated ‘These kinds of monks should not be suspended’.
Who are the monks of that kinds?”[The Buddha said:] “They are monks who are renowned,
who have great merits, who are with great learning, who are the sūtra masters, who are the
vinaya masters, who are the mātṛkā masters, who have lots of followers and retinue. Such
are the monks of that kind.”[Upāli asked:] “If that kinds of monks are suspended, what fault
ensues?”[The Buddha said:] “It is the duṣkṛta-offense. If there is one who wants to split
[the Community], it is the sthūlātyaya-offense.7 ”[Upāli continued to ask (???) :] “The
Blessed One stated, ‘I thought of a devout monk, and as like the words of the devout monk,
make a fault in accordance with the Dharma again. As brahmins said, if(->since) the fault
by the monk in accordance with Dharma is not(->cannot) made, he commits the duṣkṛta-offense.”[Upāli
asked: “The Blessed One] stated, ‘The monk who speaks in accordance with the
Dharma, must sit on a seat’. Who is the one speaking in accordance with the Dharma?”[The Buddha
said:] “They are the ones, in view of their sins, who cut each other’s hair, and provide
freedom from worldly life and how to display proper conduct.”[Upāli asked:] “The Community
having been split, if the one group does not live correctly, by whom should the spread
kaṭhina be removed?”[The Buddha said:] “Those who speak in accordance with the Dharma remove
[the kaṭhina]."[Upāli asked:] “If the suspended monk cuts hair, and provides freedom
from worldly life and how to display proper conduct, who commits a pāyantikā offense?”[The
Buddha said:] : “They are the ones who are suspended and who agrees with the one who split
the Community.”[Upāli asked:] “The Blessed One stated, ‘Śāriputra, you should distribute
the bedding properly’, who are proper [to do it]?”[The Buddha said:] “They are the ones
who will properly distribute [the bedding] to the one group.”[Upāli asked:] “The Blessed One
stated, ‘Examine and attach the broken pieces of some portion of hair which is cut into
100, but do not [examine and attach] those which makes [the Community] separate and split’.
What is the meaning of this statement?”[The Buddha said:] “Concerning the broken pieces
of some portion [of hair], the devotion should be received. The portion should be examined,
and the broken pieces should examined, but those [factors] looking for the division of
the united Community, should not be advanced.”

.

[Upāli asked: “The Blessed One stated,] ‘Two groups of Kauśāmbī having assembled together, if
they enter the Poṣadha ceremony, mediators should wish in this way to go outside of the
boundary and perform the Poṣadha ceremony’. The both groups of Kauśāmbī assembled together
and settled, and if a person offer a robe to the Community there, who has the empowerment?”[The
Buddha said:] “Where the Elder monks are, there is the authority.”[Upāli asked:] “If
there is an Elder monk in the one group, and there is another Elder monk in the second group,
which Elder monk has the authority?[The Buddha said:] “Among two monks, in which there
is a river, the distribution should be empowered.”[Upāli asked:] “By everyone how is it
distributed?”[The Buddha said:] “To whom[Upāli asked:] “If [monks] of both Vaiśali and Kauśāmbī
perform the Poṣadha ceremony together, is it deemed that the ceremony has been made?”[The
Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is not.”[Upāli asked:] “If mediators and [monks of] Kauśāmbī
perform the Poṣadha ceremony together, is it deemed that the ceremony has been made?”[The
Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is not.”[Upāli asked:] “If the mediators and [monks of] Vaiśali
perform the Poṣadha ceremony together, is it deemed that the ceremony has been made?”[The
Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is not.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “There are two groups and the community of the nuns. What time have the members
of the Community of Kauśāmbī been split?”[The Buddha said:] “It is the time when they performed
the Poṣadha ceremony separately inside the boundary.”[Upāli asked:] “When, by which
monks, have the monks of Kauśāmbī been split?”[The Buddha said:] “It was [split] by the
[monks] who do not speak in accordance with the Dharma, and by performing the Poṣadha ceremony
separately after they have lived together inside the [same] boundary.”[The Buddha continued
to say:] “It is deemed that nuns of the Community, having been split, lived separately.”[Upāli
asked:] “The nuns of the Community have been split off, and who can give them
the instruction half-monthly?”The Blessed One said: “No one should give the instruction,
but one should initially admonish them: ‘Sisters, do it properly’.”[Upāli asked:] “The Blessed
One stated, ‘Because of two kinds of things, there is the division of the Community.
[That is to say,] there is a proclamation [in the precinct of the Community] and distribution
of śalākā’. What makes [the Community] split and makes [the division of the Community]
occur suddenly? Also, if anything is accepted other than the proclamation [in the precinct
of the Community] and distribution of śalākā, is it deemed that the Community has been split?”[The
Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is not.”[Upāli asked:] “The formal ecclesiastical act
is made, and what is it?”[The Buddha said:] “If one is included in the retinue which split
[the Community], if all members of the Community are there, all members of the Community
also become guilty of an offense.”[Upāli asked:] “If all nuns of the Community stay outside
[of the boundary], should one give them the instruction half-monthly?”[The Buddha said:]
“Even if the nuns of the Community has been split off, one should give [the instruction].”[Upāli
asked:] “After one gave the precepts to the nuns of Vaiśali, and then, if there are
[nuns] of Kauśāmbī, how should one give the instruction to them?”[The Buddha said:] “He
should go outside the boundary and give the instruction.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “Reverend, the Blessed One stated, ‘There are ① monks being in discord, who perform
illegal [karman]; ② monks being united, who perform illegal [karman]; monks being united,
③ who are similar to those who perform illegal [karman]; and ④ monks being in discord,
who are similar to those who perform illegal [karman]. What is the case of the monks being
in discord, who perform illegal [karman]?”[The Buddha said:] “When they suspend [a monk
who] deserves the tarjanīyakarman, they are in discordance. In that case, being in discordance,
they perform the illegal [karman].”If it is asked, what is the case of the monks
being united, who perform an illegal [karman]?They suspend [a monk who] deserves the tarjanīyakarman,
and they also are united. In that case, being united, they perform an illegal
[karman].If it is asked, what is the case of the monks being in discordance, who are similar
to those who perform illegal [karman]?They would proclaim that a monk deserves to be suspended
in the past. After that, a motion having been made, if he is suspended, that is to
say, they being in discordance, are similar to those who perform illegal [karman].If it is
asked, what is the case of the monks being united, who are similar to those who perform
illegal [karman]?They would proclaim that a monk deserves to be suspended in the past. After
that, a motion is made and they united to suspend the monk. Such a case is that the monks
being united, are similar to those who perform the illegal [karman].If it is asked, what
is the case of the monks being in discord, who perform legal [karman]?Although they are
in discord, they suspend a monk who deserve the tarjanīyakarman. Such a case is that the monks
being in discord, perform the legal [karman].[The Buddha continued to say:] “By a single
person, if a single person is suspended, he commits the duṣkṛta-offense.If two or many
persons are suspended by a single person, up to four persons should be encircled and gathered(???).If
four persons are suspended by four persons, [if] the retinue who split [the Community]
is included, it is the sthūlātyaya-offense.”[Upāli asked:] “If all members of the
Community were drowsing when a monk is suspended, is it deemed that he is suspended?”[The
Buddha said:] “If, after the motion has been made, they drowsed, and if a monk is suspended,
it is deemed that he is suspended. [However,] they first drowsed, and then if the motion
is made, it is not deemed that he is suspended.In other formal ecclesiastical acts, if
it is proclaimed that the monk is suspended in other formal ecclesiastical acts, it is deemed
that he is suspended. If all members of the Community does not know that he is included
in the retinue which split [the Community], and then the formal ecclesiastical act is made,
they commit the sthūlātyaya-offense. [However,] if all members of the Community know
[that he is included in the retinue which split the Community], they become guilty of an offense.”
(????)[Upāli asked:] “If a monk is suspended by four persons that is not a sufficient
number, is it deemed that he is suspended?”[The Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is not. [The
four persons] include those from a layman or up to the one who drew blood of the Tathāgata
with evil intent, and if a monk is suspended [by them], it is not deemed that he is suspended.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “Reverend, the Blessed One stated, ‘A monk arrived and was present at formal
ecclesiastical acts as much as possible, but the entrustment will be accepted by those who
deserve accepting the entrustment. When the rejection is made by those, although the rejection
increases and the monks stand face to face, there is no refusal/exception, as well as
there is no rejection’. What is the case that the monks attend to the formal ecclesiastical
act?”[The Buddha said:] “Four monks, having assembled, it is proper to perform the karman,
and they are always pure as well as stay in agreement. A collegium of four is the monks
who fulfilled the required number for the karman; five monks, having assembled, they who
perform [the karman fulfilled the required number]; ten monks, having assembled, they who
perform [the karman fulfilled the required number]; twenty monks, having assembled, they
who perform [the karman] fulfilled the required number. The collegium of those monks who
are pure as well as agree in viewing is deemed/called [the monks who] fulfilled the required
number for the karman.”[Upāli asked:] “How should the rejection take place?”> [The Buddha
said:] “How is the rejection effective: the rejection is not valid by the one who stays
in the air against the one who stay on the ground. Similarly, the opposition is not valid
by the one outside the boundary against the one inside the boundary."[The Buddha continued
to say:] “Upāli, concerning increasing [of the opposition], when a novice learns the instructions
(śikṣā), if he says, ‘Do not teach the instructions’, his opposition can increase.
[Also], when a novice is ordained, if he says, ‘Do not ordain me’, his opposition can also
increase. When [a monk/a novice] is punished with the parivāsa probation, if he may say,
‘Do not punish me with the parivāsa probation’, in the same way [the opposition] also increases,
and he will be satisfied and he will be expelled. Likewise, the opposition also
increases by all instructions regarding twelve individuals.”[Upāli asked:] “Is it deemed that
[a monk] who is drowsing can be suspended?”[The Buddha said:] “After having heard of [the
result of] the motion, if the monk drowsed, it is deemed that he is suspended. [However,]
before he heard of [the result of] the motion, if the monk drowsed, it is deemed that
he is not suspended. The same applies to the case of entering into the state of abstract meditation.
Also, if a single monk is permitted to [refuse], it is deemed that the opposition
[is made].”[Upāli asked:] “The Community has been split into two groups, the one group
which lives correctly and the other which does not. When a group which is proper, suspends
[the other group], it is deemed that the group is suspended? Or, is it deemed that the group
is not suspended?”The Buddha said: “It is deemed that the group is not suspended.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “[The number of members for a formal act] is mostly fulfilled by mediators, and
then if one is suspended by those monks, is it deemed that he is suspended or not suspended?”[The
Buddha] said: "It is declared that he is suspended, and the capacity as the mediators
is not acknowledged anymore."[Upāli asked:] “Is every illegal karman, whatever it is,
a discordant karman? Also, is every discordant karman, whatever it is, an illegal karman?”[The
Buddha said;] “Upāli, it is not. An illegal karman can be also something else, and
a discordant karman can be also something else.”If it is asked, what is the case that it
is the illegal karman, and it is not the discordant karman?He to whom [the karman] is performed,
is not present, neither accused nor reminded, without acknowledges [of the offense].
As many as monk who fulfilled the number for the karman, having assembled, are present.
The entrustment having been brought from those proper [to send] the entrustment, if the opposition
is made by those, the monks who are valid to oppose are present, also make neither
a negation nor opposition. This case is that it is an illegal karman, but it is not a discordant
karman.If it is asked, what is the case that it is a discordant karman, but it is
not a illegal karman?He against whom [the karman] is performed, is present, accused, reminded
with acknowledge [of the offense]. As many monk who are eligible to fulfill the number
for the karman, they all not having assembled, are present. The entrustment not having been
brought from one proper [to grant] the entrustment, the monks who are present are qualified
to make a negation and opposition. This case is that that it is a discordant karman,
but it is a legal karman.T. 1435 describes the third and fourth possibility, on the contrary,
the Tibetan and the Sanskrit omit them.[Upāli asked:] “Is a legal karman always a united
karman?”[The Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is not. A legal karman can be also something else,
and a united karman can be also something else.”[Upāli asked:] “What is the case that it
is a legal karman, but it is not a united karman?[The Buddha] said: “Monks are present,
and accuse [the offender]. As many monks who are eligible to fulfill the number for the karman,
they all not having assembled, are not present. The entrustment not having been brought
from one proper [to grant] the entrustment, the monks who are qualified to make opposition,
are present, and make negation and opposition. This case is that it is the legal karman,
but it is not a united karman."[Upāli asked:] “What is the case that it is a united karman,
but it is not a legal karman?”[The Buddha] said: “Monks are not present, neither accuse
nor remind, without basis and acknowledgement [of the offense]. As many monk who are
eligible fulfill the number for the karman, they all having assembled, are present. The entrustment
having been brought from those proper [to grant] the entrustment, if the monks are
present, they who are valid to oppose, do not make a negation and opposition. This case
is that it is a united karman, but it is not a legal karman.”T. 1435 describes the third
and fourth possibility, on the contrary, the Tibetan and the Sanskrit omit them.[Upāli asked:]
“Does anyone who has been reprimanded up to three times before the Community, become
guilty of an offense?[The Buddha] said: “They may be or may not be [guilty of an offense].
If they are reprimanded up to three times before the Community, they become guilty of an
offense.”[Upāli asked:] “Being guilty of an offense, is there any case that [the offense]
cannot be reprimanded up to three times before the Community?”[The Buddha] said: “Even if
there is nobody reprimanding, the offense is still there.”[Upāli asked:] “To what extent is
it deemed that the acknowledgment with regard to the ultimate matter (pārājika-offense)
is expressed?”[The Buddha] said: Having committed any offense of the four pārājika-offenses,
to what extent he acknowledges it within three times before the Community to that extent
it is deemed that the acknowledgment is made with regard to the ultimate matter (pārājika-offense).”[Upāli
asked:] “If the monk who is reprimaded to be punished with the parivāsa
probation, suspends [a monk], is it deemed that he is suspended?”[The Buddha] said: “Except
for the permission of dwelling in the presence, it is deemed that he is suspended in all
other karmans.”

[Upāli asked:] “The karman is instructed beforehand, and then the pronouncement is made afterwords,
is it deemed that a monk is suspended, or is it deemed that the monk is not suspended?”[The
Buddha said:] “It is deemed that he is not suspended.”[Upāli asked: “The karman
of] the parivāsa probation is performed, and what [offense] will it be?”[The Buddha said:]
“If all members of the Community did not know [that he performed the karman], because he
is included in the retinue which split [the Community], he commits the sthūlātyaya-offense.
If all members of the Community knew [that he performed the karman], all members of the
Community become guilty of an offense as well.”[Upāli asked:] “When a monk is under the parivāsa
probation and accepts an entrustment, and then if [another] monk is suspended [by the
Community including the monk under the probation], is it deemed that he is suspended?”[The
Buddha said:] “ It is deemed that the karman is completed except the one having an obligation
[to him] as part of his close retinue.”[Upāli asked:] “If a karman is performed as
related to oneself, is it deemed that [the karman] has been performed?”[The Buddha said:]
“If there is no doubt, it is deemed that [the karman] is performed. If there is doubt, it
is deemed that [the karman] is not performed. ...> [Upāli asked:] “Reverend, the tarjanīyakarman
is performed to whom the pravāsanīyakarman was performed. They give the acknowledgement
[of the offense] in accordance with the Dharma, and also acknowledge [the offense] within
three times before the Community. Then, is it proper to train four śikṣādattaka monks
by one proclamation?”The Buddha said: “Upāli, it is not proper.”[Upāli asked:] “Is it proper
to ordain four persons by one proclamation?”[The Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is not proper.”[Upāli
asked:] “If a monk is suspended by four persons [including one] with the distribution
of śalākā, is it deemed that he is suspended?”[The Buddha said:] “It is deemed that
he is not suspended.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “If the nigarhaṇīyakarman was performed to whom the tarjanīyakarman has been
performed, is it deemed that [the nigarhaṇīyakarman] was performed?”[The Buddha said:] “The
tarjanīyakarman does not exist anymore.”[Upāli asked:] “If the pravāsanīyakarman and the
pratisaṃharaṇīyakarman were performed to whom the tarjanīyakarman has been performed, is
it deemed that [the pravāsanīyakarman and the pratisaṃharaṇīyakarman] were performed? Or,
is it deemed that [the pravāsanīyakarman and the pratisaṃharaṇīyakarman] were not performed?”[The
Buddha] said: “Although [the karman] was performed, there is no rebuke. Just as in
the case when the tarjanīyakarman was performed, in the same way, the nigarhaṇīyakarman was
performed, the pravāsanīyakarman was performed, and the pratisaṃharaṇīyakarman was performed,
and these were described in detail. Also, the same rule should apply to the four cases.”[Upāli
asked:] “If the tarjanīyakarman was performed to a suspended monk, is it deemed
that he is suspended?”[The Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is not. This is because he is not one
of fellow monks.”[Upāli asked:] “Likewise, if the nigarhaṇīyakarman, the pravāsanīyakarman,
and the pratisaṃharaṇīyakarman were performed [to a suspended monk], is it deemed that
he is suspended?”[The Buddha said:] “Upāli, it is not. This is because he is not fellow monks.
The one who splits other [groups] apart from monks, commits the duṣkṛta-offense.”[Upāli
asked:] “What is the meaning of tarjanīya?[The Buddha said:] “Upāli, although it is just
a name [of the karman], it should be employed when monks quarrel: ‘The Community will closely
examine you eventually until you or the one who causes quarrel do not return to [the
quarrel]’."[Upāli asked:] “What is the meaning of nigarhaṇīya?[The Buddha said:] “Upāli,
although nigarhaṇiya is just a name, it should be applied to monks who eventually commits
the saṃghāvaśeṣa offense: ‘You should stay with the relationship of dependence on your Preceptor
or teacher until you or the one who commits the offense again and again abstain from
[committing the offense]’.[Upāli asked:] “What is the meaning of pravāsanīya?[The Buddha
said:] “Upāli, although pravāsanīya is just a name, it should be instructed: “[You are]
a monk who is a defiler of laymen, therefore, you should not stay here [in the Community].”[Upāli
asked:] “What is the meaning of pratisaṃharaṇīya?[The Buddha said:] “Upāli, although
it is it is just a name, it should be applied to the monk who has despised laymen: ‘You
should ask forgiveness from those laymen’.”[Upāli] asked: “[The Blessed one/You] stated,
‘The Community will closely examine you eventually’. What does it mean?”[The Buddha] said:
“It means that the Community will perform the karman to you/the one who commits the fault.”[Upāli
asked:] “[The Blessed one/you] stated, ‘You should stay with the relationship of
dependence on others, your Preceptor or teacher’. What does it mean?”

[The Buddha] said: “It means that he/you/the one should stay with this kind of persons: the
one who are friendly to people; the one who functions as a guru; the one who are modest; the
one who knows shame.”

.

[Upāli asked:] “If one says, ‘You are an one-eyed person’ to the one who is not one-eyed, what
[offense] will it be?”[The Buddha said:] “Since he tells a lie deliberately, he commits
an offense. If one says, ‘You are an one-eyed person’ to the one-eyed person, he commits
an offense since he speaks of a flaw of the person.”[Upāli asked:] “[The Blessed one] stated,
‘One causes harm to a monk inside or outside’. What is the inside, and what is the outside?”[The
Buddha said:] “Inside the boundary is ‘inside’. Outside of the boundary is ‘outside’.
Also, this can mean that ‘inside the monastery’ is ‘inside’, and ‘open unsheltered
place’ is ‘outside’.”[Upāli asked:] “The Blessed one stated, ‘There are various kinds of obstacles’.
What are the dharmas which are obstacles?

[The Buddha said:] “Desire is the dhrama which is the obstacle. Upāli, I said that the desire
is the dharma which is the obstacle".
